# School Management System using Tkinter

## Overview
The *School Management System* is a desktop application developed in Python using *Tkinter* for the graphical user interface (GUI) and *PostgreSQL* for the database backend. It allows users to manage the schoolâ€™s students, instructors, and courses efficiently. The system features a range of functionalities, including adding, updating, and deleting records for students, instructors, and courses. It also allows for assigning students to courses and instructors to courses, with all data securely stored in a PostgreSQL database.

The system also supports *data backup* and *restore* through *JSON files*, making it easy to manage and persist data across sessions.

## Key Features

1. *User-Friendly Interface:*
   - Designed using *Tkinter*, the system has a clear and intuitive interface.
   - Custom *styling* applied using ttk.Style for a modern and sleek look.
   
2. *Database Integration:*
   - Integrated with *PostgreSQL* for robust data handling.
   - Data persistence for students, instructors, and courses.
   - Tables include *foreign key constraints* to maintain relationships and data integrity.

3. *Add, Update, and Delete Operations:*
   - Add new students, instructors, and courses with unique IDs.
   - Update existing records with real-time updates in the interface.
   - Delete records, with foreign key constraints ensuring cascading deletions (i.e., when a student is deleted, they are also removed from the courses they were enrolled in).

4. *Student and Instructor Management:*
   - Add students and instructors with details such as name, age, and email.
   - Assign instructors to courses.
   - Register students for courses.
   
5. *Treeview Display:*
   - View all students, instructors, and courses in a *Treeview widget*.
   - Dynamic updates to reflect the current state of the database.

6. *Search Functionality:*
   - Search records by name or ID, filtering the results dynamically in the Treeview.

7. *Data Backup and Restore:*
   - Save data to a *JSON* file for backup.
   - Load data from the JSON file into the PostgreSQL database.
   
8. *Course Management:*
   - Create and manage courses.
   - Register students for specific courses.
   - Assign instructors to courses.

## How to Run the Application

### Prerequisites
- *Python 3.x* must be installed on your system.
- Install required Python packages using pip:
  bash
  pip install tkinter psycopg2
  
- A running *PostgreSQL* instance. Set up the database and connection details as follows:
